# demo-jsCalculator
A demo learned from freeCodeCamp.

User story:

 I can add, subtract, multiply, divide and module two numbers.

 I can clear the input field with a clear button "AC",and also can back to a step with button "CE".

 I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.

The libraries used: jQuery
